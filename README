To Set up Oracle database:
1. In csil, follow the instruction posted on piazza

2. In local computer:
    (1). Download 19.3.0.0.0 Oracle Driver
    (2). Import the ocjdb8.jar into External Libraries
    (3). do command: javac -classpath <ACTUAL PATH>:. DataSourceSample.java AND
                     java -classpath <ACTUAL PATH>:. DataSourceSample
         * <ACTUAL PATH> would be the path where you download the ocjdb8.jar
         e.x., mine is /Users/BOB/Desktop/ojdbc8-full/ojdbc8.jar
    *(4). Each time connecting to database, you need to use UCSB Pulse Secure VPN to connect to the
         private network

Also, it would be convenient and clear to use SQLDeveloper, the username, password and url would be the same
